## Worst Cases (Score <= 2)

| Case ID | Score | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| hard-inference-01 | 1/5 | The output failed to extract any of the required information—name is correct but title, company, and years are all null despite clear details in the input. |
| hard-implicit-02 | 2/5 | The output incorrectly lists 'Coinbase' as the current company instead of null or 'Unemployed', contradicting the 'currently between jobs' status. While name, title, and years are accurate, the company field is a significant error given the explicit context. |

| hard-inference-02 | 5/5 ✅ | 2120ms | The output accurately captures all expected key points: correct name, company, appropriate years of experience (17, aligning with the iPhone's 2007 release), and a title that reflects leading infrastructure. |

| hard-contradiction-02 | 5/5 ✅ | 1645ms | The output accurately captures all expected key points: name is 'Tom', years is 12 (an acceptable interpretation), company is 'AWS', and title is the official 'Cloud Infrastructure Engineer'. |
| hard-noisy-01 | 5/5 ✅ | 1899ms | The output correctly extracted all required information: name as 'Maria Santos', title as 'Staff Engineer', company as 'Uber', and years of experience as 7, matching all expected key points accurately. |
| hard-noisy-02 | 4/5 ✅ | 1122ms | Correctly extracted name, title, and years of experience, but included 'Inc.' in the company name instead of just 'Apple' as expected. |
| hard-implicit-01 | 5/5 ✅ | 2016ms | All expected key points are accurately captured: name is 'Chris', title is 'senior engineer' (matching the promoted role), company is 'Spotify', and years total 5 (2 + 3). The output is well-structured and correct. |
| hard-implicit-02 | 2/5 ❌ | 1996ms | The output incorrectly lists 'Coinbase' as the current company instead of null or 'Unemployed', contradicting the 'currently between jobs' status. While name, title, and years are accurate, the company field is a significant error given the explicit context. |
| hard-math-01 | 5/5 ✅ | 2317ms | The output correctly identifies Yuki as the name, SmartNews as the current company, and accurately calculates 7 years of experience (3 at LINE + 4 at Mercari), excluding the 2-year travel gap. |
| hard-math-02 | 4/5 ✅ | 1202ms | Correctly identified name, title, and company, and reasonably calculated professional experience as 6 years (postdoc + professor). However, the name includes 'Dr.' while the expected name was 'Ahmed Hassan' without the title. |
